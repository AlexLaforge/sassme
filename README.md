# SassMe

[image soon to be here...]

Dynamically view the output of Sass color functions in the browser. The following Sass functions are available to manipulate:

- [`lighten()`](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#lighten-instance_method)
- [`darken()`](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#darken-instance_method)
- [`saturate()`](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#saturate-instance_method)
- [`desaturate()`](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#desaturate-instance_method) (same as `grayscale()`)
- [`adjust-hue()`](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#adjust_hue-instance_method)


## Notes

### History

This project was originally conceived and built at Arc90. The original repo can still be found at [arc90/sass-color-picker](https://github.com/arc90/sass-color-picker). However, due to organization conflicts, that project is no longer maintained. This is now the **officially** successor.

Many thanks to those who helped build v1.0 [LINK] of SassMe:
