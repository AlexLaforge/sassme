- [`desaturate()`](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#desaturate-instance_method) (same as `grayscale()`)

## About

This project was originally conceived and built at Arc90. When first deployed, it lived on the web at `http://sassme.arc90.com/` and the original codebase was hosted under Arc90â€™s Github account at [arc90/sass-color-picker](https://github.com/arc90/sass-color-picker). However, due to organization conflicts, that repo is no longer maintained. This is now the **official** successor.

Many thanks to those who helped build [v1.0 of SassMe](https://github.com/jimniels/sassme/releases/tag/1.0):
